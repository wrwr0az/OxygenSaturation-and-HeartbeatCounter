# OxygenSaturation-and-HeartbeatCounter


The main technical objective:
Measuring oxygen saturation and heart beats per minute. Where all the follow
stages are depending on the main technical objective.


The sensor called “MAX30101 pulse oximeter and heartrate monitor”.

The MAX30101 gets the heart rate (BPM) and the blood oxygen levels (SPO2) by using the photoplethysmography (PPG) technique. 
PPG is an optical measurement method that uses a light source and a photodiode to measure the volumetric variation of the blood circulation,
same as the old but with a much higher quality.
